- Time Spent: 0.5 hours

## DISCO
- Very similar implementation styles, using reference to a site containing the css file
- Similar workings and seems to really only change the styling
- Dev console yeilded some interesting results because it seemed to show muliple packages of css code, depending on what you want to do.

### QCC
- What is the difference between the two and what are the advantages for using either?

### q0
- 1

### q0b
- I had to talk to the Devos who generated the example code because their implementation seemed to use a 10000 line css file instead of referencing the css online
- Asked about their different uses for the parts that they implemented and possible use in story telling

### q1
- (complete when finished)
